      <span class="u">U</span>niversity Visvesvaraya College of Engineering (UVCE) was established in
      the year 1917 by Bharat Ratna Sir M Visvesvaraya. Currently affiliated to
      Bangalore University, the College provides six engineering courses –
      Electronics and Communication, Electrical and Electronics, Mechanical,
      Computer Science, Information Science and Civil Engineering. Situated at
      KR Circle in a greenery filled scenic expanse of 10 acres, UVCE is in the
      neighborhood of heavenly cubbon park and at an arm’s distance are some of
      the most important locations like Vidhana Soudha, Karnataka High Court and
      City Civil Court. The City campus currently houses the Department of
      Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Electronics and
      Communication and Computer Science Engineering. Proximity to the Metro,
      City Bus Station and Railway Station connects one easily to any part of
      the city and helps in commutation to UVCE. Situated amidst Jnana Bharathi
      Campus spread over 50 acres, the hub of University Post graduate academic
      activities, the Engineering Campus has Departments of Civil Engineering
      and Architecture. This pioneer college has grown many folds, producing
      some of the best engineers in the country. Being an institution that
      functions on only Merit- Based CET seat allotment, the students obtaining
      admission are the creamy layer of the bright students in the state. The
      inexpensive fees structure is an aid and a driving reason for students of
      difficult financial stability and from the rural to join the college. The
      college crafts an environment for allround development of students
      encompassing both academic and extra-curricular activities. The students
      are hardworking, cultured, highly disciplined and have preserved the
      cherished values of this institution over the years. UVCE instills a
      zealous essence into the students which propels them to explore new realms
      of engineering and embark to achieve great things. Enhancing this factor
      is the experience that students gain learning at UVCE in a way diff erent
      from the education system of most conventional engineering colleges.
      Undermining the visible lack of infrastructure in UVCE is the vivacity and
      learning that is meticulously propelled by the students themselves. The
      college is a hub of many technical and non- technical activities evenly
      spread throughout the year. The ever active students are teamed to nurture
      various special interest groups in college to foster their technical and
      creative skillsets on a myriad of platforms whilst helping each other. The
      entire student fraternity contributes in making each of these events a
      success. The college is currently being funded by the World Bank under the
      TEQIP project for the improvement of the quality of technical education
      through various programs and infrastructural developments. The devoted
      faculty is highly qualified, experienced and plays a pivotal role in
      enthusing the students to achieve remarkable feats. The Institution boasts
      of very good campus placements and a mighty rate of students taking up
      higher education abroad. UVCE Alumni have etched “UVCE” as a highly
      recognized institution and are keeping the esteemed honor of the
      institution flying high with their remarkable achievements in the
      respective fields/organizations. Alumni of UVCE are not only noteworthy of
      their achievements that have brought great recognition to the institution
      but have also made the nation proud on a global platform.
